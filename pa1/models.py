All models need to return a CSP object, and a list of lists of Variable objects 
representing the board. The returned list of lists is used to access the 
solution. 

For example, after these three lines of code

    csp, var_array = warehouse_binary_ne_grid(board)
    solver = BT(csp)
    solver.bt_search(prop_FC, var_ord)

var_array[0][0].get_assigned_value() should be the correct value in the top left
cell of the warehouse.

The grid-only models do not need to encode the cage constraints.

1. warehouse_binary_ne_grid
    - A model of the warehouse problem w/o room constraints built using only 
      binary not-equal constraints for the row/column constraints.

2. warehouse_nary_ad_grid
    - A model of the warehouse problem w/o room constraints built using only n-ary 
      all-different constraints for the row/column constraints. 

3. warehouse_full_model
    - A model of the warehouse problem built using either the binary not-equal or n-ary
      all-different constraints for the row/column constraints.
